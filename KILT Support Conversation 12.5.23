There's no standard CType yet defined for real estate tokens. You are free to design a CType that fits your needs.

Great thanks‚Ä¶ once we have should we share to a library?

We have a CType index that we are trying to maintain with all created CTypes on Spiritnet: https://github.com/KILTprotocol/ctype-index
If you do create a new CType, please open a PR against the repo to update the index üòä

That‚Äôs great - thanks Antonio
one other thing‚Ä¶ if we create a real estate property DID (which is controlled by the real estate developer initially‚Ä¶ can control then be transferred to multiple other DIDs? (As we are fractionalising the property through NFTs)
I suppose we could issue a credential ‚Äúproperty owner‚Äù the same as if the property was a company with one or more owners / directors. Do you think that would work?

Yes right now DIDs can only be controlled by a single key, be it sr25519, ed25519, or ecdsa. Hence multi-tenant support right now can only be supported by building an additional layer on top of them, with credentials, as you correctly pointed out.
